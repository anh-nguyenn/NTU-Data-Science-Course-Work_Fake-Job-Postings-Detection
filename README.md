## Detecting Fake Job Postings with Machine Learning üë©‚Äçüíªü§ñ

### Overview üåê
Welcome to the "Koviema" team's project on detecting online fake job postings using machine learning models. In response to the rise in fraudulent job listings during the COVID-19 pandemic, our goal is to develop an accurate classification model to filter out fake job postings and protect individuals from scams.

### Project Presentation üìä
Part 1: Data Analysis by Jason

Our project begins with a comprehensive data analysis. We explore the dataset, clean the data, and identify correlations. The focus is on understanding the characteristics of job postings, with an emphasis on those in the United States. We delve into numerical, categorical, and text data, revealing insights that lay the groundwork for further analysis.

Part 2: Random Forest Classification by Juneyoung

Juneyoung takes us through the application of Random Forest Classification. The dataset is preprocessed, and features are transformed into numerical data for consistency. Decision trees are constructed to identify key indicators of fake job postings, revealing patterns such as the lack of information in fraudulent posts. The Random Forest model achieves impressive accuracy, outperforming individual decision trees and highlighting the importance of text length in detecting fraudulent data.

Part 3: Natural Language Processing by Anh Nguyen (Jerry)

Jerry explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) to further enhance our model. Four different machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and XGBoost, are compared. The results show that Random Forest and XGBoost perform exceptionally well, with Random Forest exhibiting the highest recall, indicating its ability to correctly classify non-fraudulent values. The ROC analysis confirms the model's overall effectiveness, especially considering the imbalanced dataset.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, our project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning, particularly Random Forest, in detecting fake job postings. The combination of data analysis, Random Forest Classification, and NLP provides a robust solution to address the challenges posed by fraudulent job listings. We recommend exploring this README for a deeper understanding of our methodology and findings.
